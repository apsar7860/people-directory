This project is a two-page web application built using React, TanStack Table, React Hook Form, Zod, and styled with Tailwind CSS. The application features a Dashboard page and a People Directory page with a fully interactive table.

## Technologies Used

### Page 2: People Directory

- **Interactive Table**: Displays a list of people with the following features:

  - **Sortable Columns**: Columns are sortable with three states (initial, ascending, descending).
  - **Editable Rows**: Each row includes an Edit button that opens a form to update the personâ€™s details using React Hook Form and Zod.
  - **Filter Options**: Filter by role or team.
  - **Global Search**: A search bar for filtering rows based on a substring match.
  - **Add Member**: Opens a form to add a new entry to the table.
  - **Delete Entry**: Each row includes a Delete button to remove the entry.
